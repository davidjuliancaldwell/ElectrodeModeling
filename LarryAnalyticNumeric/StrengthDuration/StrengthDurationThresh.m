% Based on this paper, here’s a little homework problem for you:
% Jeff mentioned that the stimulation currents that you measure using the TDT are lower than 
% those obtained using the Ojemann stimulator. Calculate how much lower they would be using
% the stimulation-duration curves in the paper. (Hint: compare 1.2 msec with 50 microseconds.)
% Compare the results of your calculation with the experimental results.

% Here are some of the other useful, interesting, or both papers that I found:
% 
% 
% 
% I especially recommend "DES vs EMS 2015.pdf”
% 
% Today, I will return to the calculations. First up: two electrode, bipolar/biphasic, constant current, with csf.
